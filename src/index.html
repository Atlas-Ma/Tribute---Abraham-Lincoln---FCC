  <h2>Here's a list of Abraham's well known accomplishments:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li> He was the only president to have a patent: Lincoln invented a device to free steamboats that ran aground.</li>
    
    <li>He practiced law without a degree. Lincoln had about 18 months of formal schooling.</li>
    
    <li>He wanted women to have the vote in 1836. The future president was a suffragette before it became fashionable.</li>
    
    <li>He was a big animal lover, but he wouldn’t hunt or fish. If he were alive today, Lincoln would be running an animal shelter.</li>
    <li>He really was a wrestler. Lincoln was documented as taking part in wrestling bouts. We don’t think he wore a mask or had a manager.</li>
    <li>He lost in his first bid for a presidential ticket. The unknown Lincoln was an unsuccessful vice presidential candidate in 1856 at the Republican convention</li>
  </ul>
